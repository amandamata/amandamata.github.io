      <description>What is a queue? A queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of sequence. Wikipedia
Imagine that we have a user&amp;rsquo;s API.
We can create users in the system and then retrieve them back, maybe update and maybe delete them, send an email to the user, and also make a request to another API.</description>
