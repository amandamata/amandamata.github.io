This pass week I wake up early every day trying to do only one thing: make Visual Studio Code insert a new line before a curly bracket, braces {}.
I have this:
if (true){ // do something } and I want to format it like this:

You&amp;rsquo;ve just installed linux and you&amp;rsquo;re used to the structure of windows and its directories, so you&amp;rsquo;ll take a look in your file manager looking for the disk C: and you can&amp;rsquo;t find it&amp;hellip; Knowing Linux directories can help administer the system and understand how it works.

What is a queue? A queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of sequence. Wikipedia
Imagine that we have a user&amp;rsquo;s API.
We can create users in the system and then retrieve them back, maybe update and maybe delete them, send an email to the user, and also make a request to another API.</description>
