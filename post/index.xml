      <title>How to remove sensitive information from commit history</title>

      <description>Today I learned something extremely useful: how to efficiently remove sensitive information from commit history.
I believe that at some point, we have all made the mistake of accidentally pushing sensitive information to a repository on GitHub. Simply deleting the information does not solve the problem because the commit history will still show the previous version with that sensitive information.
To address this issue, people often use git-filter-branch. However, I would like to introduce an even better alternative: BFG.</description>

      <title>Implementing Redis caching with dotnet</title>

      <description>I recently had to implement a cache in an application to avoid unnecessary database queries, and that was cool. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with Redis in the past, but I think I&amp;rsquo;ve done it the wrong way because implementing a cache with Redis has never been so cool. Redis vs Mem cached Redis is almost like a NoSql database, but it is even better because it stores data with key and values and with that, it is much easier to use it as a cache.</description>

      <description>In this post, I pass an introduction to a queue and how to use it. Now I gonna explain how to implement an sqs consumer and publisher using c# dotnet. SQS What is SQS?
SQS (Simple Queue Service) is an Amazon service that lets you send, store, and receive messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available.
The best part is free, actually to pay for this service you gonna need to send over 1 million requests per month then amazon is going to bill you.</description>

      <description>This pass week I wake up early every day trying to do only one thing: make Visual Studio Code insert a new line before a curly bracket, braces {}.
I have this:
if (true){ // do something } and I want to format it like this:
if (true) { // do something } Was not as easy thing as may seem. Many sites and stack overflow have the same question, with many disappointing people without a resolution.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve just installed linux and you&amp;rsquo;re used to the structure of windows and its directories, so you&amp;rsquo;ll take a look in your file manager looking for the disk C: and you can&amp;rsquo;t find it&amp;hellip; Knowing Linux directories can help administer the system and understand how it works.
If we analyze windows and linux, they ended up evolving differently in terms of directory structure. Linux is much more like any other system with unix roots like macOS.</description>

      <description>What is a queue? A queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of sequence. Wikipedia
Imagine that we have a user&amp;rsquo;s API.
We can create users in the system and then retrieve them back, maybe update and maybe delete them, send an email to the user, and also make a request to another API.</description>
