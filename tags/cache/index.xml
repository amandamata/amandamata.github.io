      <description>I recently had to implement a cache in an application to avoid unnecessary database queries, and that was cool. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with Redis in the past, but I think I&amp;rsquo;ve done it the wrong way because implementing a cache with Redis has never been so cool. Redis vs Mem cached Redis is almost like a NoSql database, but it is even better because it stores data with key and value and with that, it is much easier to use it as a cache.</description>
